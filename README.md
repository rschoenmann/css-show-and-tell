I chose to research rounded corners in CSS, which you can achieve using the `border-radius` property. This defines the radius of an element's corners, so you can make it as rounded (or not) as you'd like! Additionally, since the `border-radius` property actually refers to the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left radius in that order, you can specify a different `border-radius` for all four corners, three corners, two opposing corners, or one value for all corners.

I found this link very helpful in learning about rounded corners, particularly because it lets you play around with the values so you can see how the corners look at different values!
